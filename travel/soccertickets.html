        <h2>Soccer (including tickets to matches)</h2>
        <hr>
        
        <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Madrid is world-known for two of its professional football teams, <a href="https://www.realmadrid.com/en">Real Madrid</a> (2018 UEFA Champions Leage winner) and <a href="http://www.atleticodemadrid.com/">Atl&eacute;tico de Madrid</a> (2018 UEFA Europa League winner).</p>

        <ul>
          <li> Football fans won't want to miss a visit to the magnificent Santiago Bernab&eacute;u, home to the legendary Real Madrid football team. If so, you should do the <a href="https://www.realmadrid.com/en/tickets/bernabeu-tour">Bernab&eacute;u Tour</a> which takes around 150 minutes and costs 25 &euro;.
          <li> Apart from visiting the Santiago Bernab&eacute;u Stadium, attendees can also visit the <a href="http://en.atleticodemadrid.com/noticias/take-a-tour-of-the-wanda-metropolitano">new Wanda Metropolitano Stadium</a> and see its facilities, inaugurated in September 2017. The Wanda Metropolitano will host the final game of the UEFA European Champions League in May 2019.
        </ul>

        <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp <b>Getting tickets</b> to watch Real Madrid matches is not easy (and certainly expensive). If you want to attend one match of the Spanish LaLiga at the Bernab&eacute;u, you should buy tickets well in advance, as tickets get sold-out fast. However, the definite date and time of the match is finally set just three weeks in advance, and could be on Saturday or on Sunday. During the week of ICSME, following matches will take place in the Bernab&eacute;u stadion:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> <b>Real Madrid vs Espanyol</b> (22nd September 20:45). <a href="https://realmadrid.entradas.com/sports-web/Real_Madrid/Futbol/2018-2019/LALIGA_2018-2019/REAL_MADRID_CF_-_RCD_ESPANYOL/">Official tickets</a> can be bought directly around two weeks in advance (until then only expensive VIP tickets can be bought). <i>Madridistas</i> have priority when purchasing tickets. If you are not a <i>Madridista</i>, you <a href="https://www.realmadrid.com//en/fans/madridistas/discounts-benefits-promotions/priority-access-to-bernabeu-tickets">can become one and enjoy having ticket purchase priority</a> (i.e., tickets are available to <i>Madridistas</i> two days before than to the general public).</li>
          <li> <b>Real Madrid vs Atl&eacute;tico de Madrid</b> (29th September 20:45). <a href="https://realmadrid.entradas.com/sports-web/Real_Madrid/Futbol/2018-2019/LALIGA_2018-2019/REAL_MADRID_CF_-_C._AT._DE_MADRID/">Official tickets</a> can be bought around two weeks in advance (until then only expensive VIP tickets can be bought). <i>Madridistas</i> have priority when purchasing tickets. If you are not a <i>Madridista</i>, you <a href="https://www.realmadrid.com//en/fans/madridistas/discounts-benefits-promotions/priority-access-to-bernabeu-tickets">can become one and enjoy having ticket purchase priority</a> (i.e., tickets are available to <i>Madridistas</i> two days before than to the general public).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Another option is to try to get tickets using the secondary marketplace <a href="https://www.onlineticketexpress.com/sports/football/real-madrid-tickets">onlineticketexpress.com</a> or the ticket resale site <a href="https://www.viagogo.com/Sports-Tickets/International-Soccer/More-Soccer/Spanish-Premier-League/Real-Madrid-FC-Tickets/">Viagogo</a> (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viagogo">Wikipedia page on Viagogo</a>).
