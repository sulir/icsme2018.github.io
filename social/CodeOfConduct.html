      <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
      <hr>
      
      <p style="font-size:16px; text-indent:2em; text-align:justify;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Please show respect for those around you. This applies to both in-person and online behavior. The central goal of a conference is to encourage the open exchange of ideas through free expression. This requires an environment that enables all to participate without fear of harassment. ICSME is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion (or lack thereof).</p>

      <p style="font-size:16px; text-indent:2em; text-align:justify;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; All communication should be appropriate for a technical audience, including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language, innuendo, and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>

      <p style="font-size:16px; text-indent:2em; text-align:justify;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; We thank the <a href="http://www.curry-on.org/2016/code-of-conduct.html">Curry on Rome</a> conference for the text of this code of conduct. Curry On states that its code of conduct is derived with thanks from the Codes of Conduct produced by the ACM, SNAPL, PNW Scala, NE Scala, and the Geek Feminism Wiki.</p>
